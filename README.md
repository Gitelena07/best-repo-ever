# best-repo-ever

Hello! It's my first repository, which I test with Git. I'm working now in the branch 'myfeaturebranch'.
### My notes
Here is some new content. Just a different second change...
* Test third-step commit (Working -> Staging -> History).
* Now I'll add another comment to check the new changes.
